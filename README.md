# crewScheduling

It is a tool to generate a pilot schedule, given start date, 
company data (fleet and network).

It stores company and pilot information between sessions.

A simple menu (not robust!) allows some operation on pilots.

Inside the folder flight_generator there is a tool
to generate a schedule file in FSC format from Flightradar24
json data.

Enjoy!!
